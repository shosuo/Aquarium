    <img src="images/Fishy.jpg" class="img-rounded pull-right img-responsive" alt="Breeding and caring for the oscar fish in aquarium" height="296" width="416">
    <p>Oscars are considered to be the most intelligent aquarium fish available to hobbyists.
         Oscars have an impeccable memory and are one of the few aquarium pets that
          can be trained to do tricks and individually distinguish its carer. Oscars 
          are often available in a few different colors. The most popular being black 
          with bright red scale colorations through its center. Other less common variations
           include a bright albino white with translucent red eyes, shades of pale blue and
            even banana yellow.</p><p>Unfortunately Oscars not community fish with the 
                exception of being kept with other big fish in a very large tank. Before
                 purchasing this ‘tiny’, ‘cute’ little fish in the pet store, 
                 it is important to realize that they grow very big, very fast.
                  Oscars are often bought at the size of a few inches or less, but
                   within a year they can grow to be closer to 8” long. At this point
                    they will be around the size of a small dinner plate.</p><p>Oscars 
                        are very messy eaters and constantly defecate there digested food
                         around the aquarium. This is partly due to their carnivorous nature
                          and large appetites. To prevent poor water quality, Oscars require
                     more maintenance than other fish. It is recommended water changes 
                occur at least twice a week to siphon out excess waste.</p>
        <img src="images/Long_finned_oscar.jpg" class="img-rounded pull-right img-responsive" alt="long-finned oscar" width="315" height="209">
        <p>Oscars can be a lot of fun when it comes to feeding time. They are one of the few
             aquarium species you are able to hand feed. They will often grab the food right
              between your fingers! Oscars are not fussy about which foods they are given and for
               this reason it is important to feed them a mixed diet of commercial vitamin
                boosting foods and live/frozen foods.</p><p>Oscars need good water quality as do
                     most aquarium fish species. Poor water quality will spark noticeable mood 
                     changes, discoloration and lack of appetite. It is important to pick up on
                      these indicators early, test the water and complete a water change.</p>
                      <p>Oscars can become angry and aggressive when housed with other species
                         of aquarium fish. It is highly recommended to keep Oscars in a species
                          only aquarium. They do well kept in pairs or groups of 4-5+ without too 
                          much trouble. Always try to avoid housing 3 Oscars as two may become 
                          a pair, outcasting the third. It is important to house Oscars together 
                          from a young age. Introducing an Oscar to the aquarium later on can 
                          promote territorial disputes that may never be resolved and result in
                           constant harassment within the aquarium.</p>
                           <p>Oscars can be very difficult to breed in captivity. This
                             is partly due to the difficulty in finding a pair of mature
                             
                             fertile Oscars. Some hobbyists have reported first time success,
                              but raising the young can prove to be a challenge. Read below for
                               more information on breeding.</p>

                                    <li>The optimum aquarium temperature for Oscars is around 74°F - 81°F (23°C-27°C).
                                         Try to avoid fluctuations in temperature as Oscars can be sensitive to these
                                          changes.</li>
