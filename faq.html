        <div class="page-beeline">FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS</div><br>
        <p>This is a list of the questions most frequently asked by other hobbyists and beginner aquarists. If these answers do not 
            satisfy, feel free to send an email via the contact page and we will post your question and answer.</p>
        <h2 class="numbered-title-smaller">Why is my aquarium water cloudy?</h2><hr>
        <ul class="beautiful-list-smaller">
        <p>Your aquarium water may be cloudy for a number of reasons, to begin it depends on the colour of the water.
             If it is a green then most likely you have green water, an annoying type of algae that is hard to get rid of, 
             i suggest you keep the tank out ofdirect sunlight, do water changes and maybe buy a UV filter.</p>
        <p>If it is a cloudy white this can be due to a few reasons. The most likely is you have recently set up this tank, what you
             are seeing is a bacteria bloom that will soon pass (anywhere from 1 day to a couple of weeks). This bloom or mini cycle
              can also happen if you change a large amount (say more than 50%) of the tanks water or if you wash the filter media.
               Try to avoid doing either of these things. Overstocking and overfeeding can cause a light haze, maybe reduce both of
                these.</p>
        <p>It could also be dust from a new ornament you have put in, you may need to do constant water changes 
                    to get rid of this. Substrates like Fluorite can make the tank cloudy for the first few weeks but will clear up 
                    later on.</p></ul>
        <h2 class="numbered-title-smaller">How long should I leave my lights on?</h2>
            <hr>
        <ul class="beautiful-list-smaller"><p>For a planted tank 8-10 hours a day will be more than sufficient.
         Be sure to keep the tank out of direct sunlight as this will only promote the growth of algae in the aquarium.
          Don’t leave the aquarium lights on for 24 hours a day, the fish and plants need to respire and rest. This would lead to 
          the eventual death of fish and plants.</p></ul><h2 class="numbered-title-smaller">Do fish sleep?</h2>
        <hr>
        <ul class="beautiful-list-smaller">
        <p>Yes it has been proven that fish do sleep during the night. It is important to let them get there rest by giving the
        
            aquarium sufficient darkness during the night. If prolonged viewing hours are an issue, it is best to use lighting
             during day hours and then at night add some moonlights for added viewing time. Have a read of
             <a href="moonlights.html">DIY Moonlights</a></p></ul>
        <h2 class="numbered-title-smaller">Will fish only grow relative to the tank size?</h2><hr>
    <ul class="beautiful-list-smaller">
        <p>This is a misconception that is not true. Larger fish will soon need a larger aquarium to be healthy and happy. 
        Restricting them to a smaller aquarium may stunt the fish growth and result in physical deformities. Be sure to give
         the right environment each species of fish in the aquarium.</p></ul>
    <h2 class="numbered-title-smaller">Why are all of my fish starting to die?</h2><hr>
    <ul class="beautiful-list-smaller"><p>This may be due to a number of reasons. If it is a new tank, 
        the tank may be going through the stage of turning ammonia into nitrite, in most tanks this can and will reach toxic 
        levels and may kill your fish, to stop this do small 10-15% water changes each day.</p>
    <p>Other reasons could be something contaminated put into the tank recently, a new rock or sculpture. Disease in some 
        species of fish can be common; it is not unknown for a whole species of fish to suddenly die due to a break down in there 
        immune system. Make sure the temperature is still high and you are feeding them a varied diet.</p>
    <p>Check your water levels, you will probably find spikes of ammonia or nitrite in the water. Sometimes it can be more simple, 
        if you forget to put water conditioner when you do a water change you have the chance of letting in toxic 
        chlorine and chloramines, if this may be it, use some now.</p>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="numbered-title-smaller">How long do I have to wait for my tank to cycle?</h2><hr>
    <ul class="beautiful-list-smaller">
        <p>You have to wait until the nitrite spike has gone and nitrates are starting to rise, for a new aquarium this will be
             anywhere from 2-8 weeks, it is very wise to wait for this to end, because if you add more fish at this stage it will
         only put more pressure on the bacteria and most likely kill your fish.</p>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="numbered-title-smaller">How many fish can I keep in my tank?</h2><hr>
    <ul class="beautiful-list-smaller">
        <p>A good guide for keeping fish in your tank is about 1” of fish per 1 gallon of water. For larger fish it is recommended
             only 1” of fish for every 3 gallons of water. Larger fish often have a higher strain on the tanks biological bacteria 
             and filter media.</p><p>After gravel, rocks, plants, decor there will be far less volume in the aquarium. Ensure you are
                 aware of the adult size the fish in the aquarium will grow. This will help in understanding how many fish to stock 
                 at this stage. It is no use stocking a 30 gallon tank with 25” of fish and then finding out that the fish will grow
                  to 2” each, leaving you with 50” of fish.</p>
        </ul>
    <h2 class="numbered-title-smaller">Can I create a planted tank on a budget?</h2><hr>
    <ul class="beautiful-list-smaller">
        <p>Yes, following the typical convention of high light, substrate, ferts and co2 is not the only route to a beautiful 
            planted aquarium. Low-tech setups with low lighting and minimal fertilizers are an excellent budget conscious option.
             However it is recommended to only use low light plants such as java-ferns, Amazon swords, moss and anubais. Some stem 
             plants will also do well in lower light conditions.</p></ul>
             <h2 class="numbered-title-smaller">Does PMDD work? Have you used it?</h2><hr>
             <ul class="beautiful-list-smaller">
                <p>Yes &amp; Yes. PMDD works wonders and is another budget conscious approach to having a planted aquarium. 
                    Ensure to under dose as apposed to overdosing. This can overload the system with organic material and lead to an
                     algae outbreak. I personally still use this recipe. I receive similar results from PMDD as commercial
                      fertilizers at minimal cost. One thing to look out for is copper additives, in a shrimp tank these will have
                       a negative impact on shrimp health.</p></ul>
         <h2 class="numbered-title-smaller">Why is there so much algae in my aquarium?</h2><hr>
          <ul class="beautiful-list-smaller">
            <p>Algae problems are infuriating and generally exist due to a number of reasons. There may be an unbalance of nutrients 
                in the water, you might have too much lighting and not enough co2 and fertilizers, the plants can only consume these 
                three in an equal ratio so having an off balance on one will lead to an algae outbreak.</p>
                <p>Algae may also grow on slower growth plants like anubais and java fern. This is very common and manual removal 
                    of the algae is recommended. If you have constant algae problems and are near direct sunlight try to reduce this 
                    during the day as it will be a major contributor to the amount of algae. If you feed too much or put in too much
                     fertilizer it will once again cause the imbalance and a rise in algae.</p>
