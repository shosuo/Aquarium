            <br>
            <p>Aquascaping is a learned art form that allows you to create an underwater landscape, 
                inspiration for many works come from both underwater locations but also natural scenes such as
                 mountains, jungles, deserts, waterfalls and many others.</p>

                 <br><p>Designing an aquascape <em>can be challenging</em>. 
                    Aquascaping involves using basic principles of design and applying them to the aquarium. 
                    Browsing other aquascapes can <b>help you decide</b> 
                    what style and layout you enjoy the most. To aid in your designing process this page is 
                    filled with some stunning examples of aquascaping.</p>

                            Before we jump in and explore aquascaping you will need a functioning aquarium environment.
                             Aquascaping setups can <b>differ significantly</b> 
                             from standard tropical setups. This is because some aquatic plants require <b>
                            stronger lighting</b> and nutrient rich substrates to thrive.</p>
                            <p>Each link below walks through an <b>important parameter</b> to consider when setting up 
                                your aquascape or converting your current aquarium to a planted one. 
                            Low maintenance aquascapes have since become popular in the hobby. 
                            These utilize minimal CO2, less fertilizer supplementation and low wattage lighting. 
                            Lower lighting setups can be just as stunning but are limited to a smaller variety of plants.
                             These usually include ferns, moss, crypts and anubias.</p>

        <hr>
        <p>After placing your substrate, connecting up your CO2 and turning on your lights on you are 
            almost ready to go. Below we will run through some fundamentals of design and aquascaping.</p><br>
            <img src="images/rainbow-fish.jpg" class="img-responsive img-rounded" width="825" height="311" alt="rainbowfish in a natural aquascape"><br>
            <p>Now it’s time to aquascape. Before we start it’s important to remember that the biggest factor in Aquascaping is patience and imagination. Use inspiration from other works, sketches, models and mockups. Spend your time planning your idyllic aquascape.
                 You will find out it is not as hard as you may think to create 
                 something truly inspiring. Remember, nothing is concrete. 
                 If you design something, create it and dislike it, 
                 take it down! Destroy and rebuild it as many times as you 
                 want until you are satisfied with your own box of nature.</p><br>
            <h2 class="numbered-title">Taking Inspiration From Nature</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>Aquascaping is inspired by natural landscapes. 
            Grassy hills, rocky canyons and pebble streams are commonly recreated. 
            Below are two photographs from nature that could inspire your next aquascape.</p><br>
            <img src="images/inspiration2.jpg" class="img-responsive img-rounded" width="825" height="377" alt="1">
            <p>This image above of rocky steeples and trees could be seen to be similar to the first
                 image on this page. Trees have been substituted for a 
                foreground plant and the lake has been substituted for the 
                substrate in the aquarium.</p><br>
            <img src="images/inspiration3.jpg" class="img-responsive img-rounded" width="825" height="377" alt="1">
            <p>An open channel in the center of the image has become a 
                common theme among modern aquascapes. 
                This photo, taken in Iceland is a beautiful wild location
             that could be used as the inspiration for an aquascape. 
             The steep built up cliffs could be substituted with rocks 
             covered in a fine leaved Christmas or Java moss.</p>

             <hr>
             <h3>Iwagumi Style</h3>
             <p>Iwagumi aquariums represents minimalism, 
                Japanese culture and ideology.
                 They are bold yet subtle and sharp while maintaining 
                 softer elements. Generally <b>
                    larger and intricate stones</b>
                     are placed in focal points. These are the most 
                beautiful stones and can be tilted with water flow to 
                mimic a natural environment.</p>
                <p>Iwagumi aquascapes will often use only <b>
                    low foreground plants</b>.
                 Emphasis is put on the rocks and not the plants in an 
                Iwagumi setup. Dark and intricate rocks are highly sought 
                after for these aquascapes.</p>

                <h3>Dutch Style</h3>
                <p>Dutch style aquascapes are <b>about the plants</b>. 
                    In a traditional Dutch Aquascape there is far less emphasis on the rocks and wood. The choice of plants, color of the plants and 
                    their arrangement is by far the most important.</p>
                <p>Dutch aquascapes are a popular style as they can be visually 
                    stunning. They are often filled with bright red, orange and green
                     plants that fill the foreground, middle and background. 
                     Dutch aquascaping is also known for housing unusual and 
                     difficult plant species. Generally dutch aquascapes are the <b>
                        most time intensive</b> 
                        and difficult to maintain.</p>

                    <h3>Natural Style</h3>
                    <p>Natural style aquascapes attempt to <b>recreate a section of nature</b>. 
                        Plants, wood and rocks are arranged to look like a stream or lake.
                         They are very popular and often have an 'unruly' characteristic to them.
                          Most modern aquascapes follow a natural style.</p>
                    <p>The arrangement of the plants, wood and stones is the most important. 
                        The fish are just <b>complementary in aquascaping</b>. 
                        Being able to create a simulated natural environment is difficult and
                 requires planning. Plants in these aquascapes are often purchased small and 
                 attatched to the wood, rocks or substrate to grow into the aquarium. A
                  school of small fish are usually chosen to give the aquascape added size and 
                  movement.</p>

                    <p><b>Becoming frustrated</b> – lets face it, you have seen countless beautiful aquascapes
                         over the internet. Just remember many of these tanks have taken hours of hard work 
                         and patience. Your aquascape will get there too.</p>
                         <p><b>Using few plant species</b> – 
                            don't fall into the trap of using just one or two species of plants. 
                            Aquascaping is about exploring with the diversity of flora and hardscape to produce
                             a beautiful aquarium – mix it up and experiment with a range of species.</p>
                             <p><b>Using too many plants with large leaves</b> - 
                                larger plants have their time and place but will make your aquascape seem shallower
                                 and small. The finer the leaves on the plants you use, the larger your scape will
                                  seem.</p><p><b>Keep it simple stupid</b> – negative space is sometimes your best 
                                    friend. Avoid feeling like you have to fill every open space with plants or
                                 rocks. Often the best aquariums are those which are the most simple.</p><br>

                        <hr><p><b>Avoid Symmetry</b> - Symmetry is not wanted in planted tanks as symmetry results
                             in the aquascape looking too structured and neat.
                              The aim is to mimic a natural environment. 
                              In the wild plants rocks would be littered around the river bank and plants would not
                               be in a line or pattern. Try not to create patterns and avoid a symmetrical aquascape.

                                Off Center Focal Point</b> 
                                The central focus should not be in the middle of the aquarium but slightly off center. 
                                Using the golden ratio (A ratio that has long been accepted as mathematically aesthetic)
                                 the optimum focal point should be around 1 : 1.62 of the tanks length.</p>

                                            measure. Divide the length by 100. 
                                            Multiply your answer by 61.8 and write it down. Now measure from one side of the 
                                            aquarium and make a small mark when you reach this new length. This 
                                            should be the focal point of your aquascape.</p>

Pick mixed plant species of lighter and darker greens. This will help your aquascape to look less structured. The size of the leaves will change the look of the tank, large leaves will make the tank look smaller but smaller leaves will make the tank look much bigger than what it actually is. Be careful not to clump all of each plant type together, this looks more like a store than an aquarium.</p><br><h2 class="numbered-title">

It will also help to bury the root system without damaging the plant. These are essential for planting foreground plants such as Hairgrass and HC.</p><br>

Aquascaping is generally compatible with most fish species. Tetra's, Discus, Angelfish, Australian Rainbows and livebearers are all great choices. While Cichlids and high pH fish are generally not recommended. This article <a href="http://blog.aquariuminfo.org/the-10-best-aquascaping-fish/">'The 10 best Aquascaping Fish'</a> has a close look at some of the popular choices. Small, schooling fish are ultimately very popular in aquascaping. Small fish can give the illusion of a much larger aquarium. While schooling fish add a sense of unity to the aquascape.</p><p><b>Schooling Fish are Recommended</b> - Good examples of schooling fish include most Tetras and dwarf varieties of Australian Rainbow Fish. Threadfin Rainbowfish, Praecox Rainbowfish and other dwarf varieties will school in larger groups in a suitably sized aquarium. Ember Tetra's have also gained in popularity. This is most likely due to their small size, bright coloration and schooling personality.</p><img src="images/gold_archerfish_toxotidae-other1.jpg" class="img-responsive img-rounded" style="display: inline-block" width="223" height="149" alt="10"> <img src="images/aquarium-fish-231.jpg" class="img-responsive img-rounded" width="200" style="display: inline-block" height="125" alt="4"> <img src="images/fishes-in-pond.jpg" style="display: inline-block" class="img-responsive img-rounded" width="115" height="125" alt="9"><p><b>Small Fish make the Aquarium Bigger</b> - Choose smaller fish to make the aquascape seem larger. Incredibly, the first image on this page is a tank little more than 12 inches in length. The fine leaves of the HC carpet and the tiny school of Ember Tetra's give the illusion of a tank at least 3 feet in length!</p><p><b>Colorful Fish are not Essential</b> - Colourful fish are recommended but not essential, with lots of plants the fish are not the predominant feature and there colors will not show as brightly.
